we will use ensemble learning to predict the pKa value, a fundamental quantity in
chemistry that measures the strength of an acid or a base. The pKa value represents the pH at which an acid or a base is half-ionized. In simple terms, the lower the pKa of an acid, the more acidic it is; whereas the higher the pKa of a base, the more basic it is. pKa values are widely used to explain the behavior of molecules in solution, such as their reactivity, solubility, and stability
